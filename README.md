### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my repo! Here you will find some personal projects and repo's that were created for the sole purpose of learning and practicing software development.

👨🏼‍💻 Checkout my porfolio here: https://lirad.dev

📚 I have a bachelor and specialization in business management that I am finding more useful every day as I dig deeper into coding. 
I am undergoing the Microverse Full Stack Development program (Go Team Neptune!): doing a lot of pair programming, code reviews, and self-development (it has been a great experience so far).

🔭 Currently working on https://lyne.in - developed using VueJS and Google's Firestore - a virtual queue where you can join using a QrCode (very good for social distancing) and at Meu Atendimento https://meuatendimento.com.br (ReactJS and Ionic) software that help's retailers find out why they are losing sales.

🌱 What's next? I am learning Ruby on Rails as a traditional backend language and exploring serverless cloud technologies such as Firestore and AWS Amplify.

👀 I am looking for a remote opportunity as a front-end developer, so if you are looking for someone, let me know! It will be a pleasure to talk with you.

✌🏼 Thanks for reading!
