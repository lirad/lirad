### Hi there 👋


Welcome to my repo! Here you will find some personal projects (very soon) and repo's that were created for the sole porpuse of learning and practicing software development.

📚 I have a bachelor and specialization in business management which I am finding more useful everyday as I dig deeper into coding, right now taking the Microverse's Full Stack Developement course  ### Go Team Neptune!  : doing a lot of pair programming, code review's and self development (it is been a great experience so far).

🔭 I’m currently working on https://lyne.in (VueJS and Google's Firestores) a virtual queue where you can join using a QrCode (very good for social distancing) and at Meu Atendimento https://meuatendimento.com.br (ReactJS and Ionic) a software that help's reatailer's find out why they are losing sales.

🌱 Right now I am learning Ruby on Rails as a traditional backend main language and exploring serveless cloud technologies as Firestore and AWS Incognito.

👀 I am looking for a remote oportunity as a front-end developer, so if you are in the looking for someone let me know! It will be a pleasure to talk with you.

✌🏼 Thanks for reading!
